### I'm a creative writer with a technical mind

I am what happens when art and science sit down and have an extended conversation. With an MFA in writing from Columbia University, and nearly twenty years working in science and biotechnology-related fields, I am at my happiest when I can dig into a complex problem, listen for overarching themes, and emerge to tell an actionable story.

In practical terms, this may take the form of videos or immersive experiences depicting cutting-edge science, writing that describes patient or caregiver experiences on the forefront of healthcare, or strategic insights that guide brand or product development for companies leading the genomics revolution.
