I am always grateful when clients want to explore a health topic in order to improve patient outcomes. Early mobility is the seemingly counterintuitive practice of encouraging critically ill patients to move - to flex, to sit up, and even to get up and walk while still on a ventilator. I led editorial development for this project that examined the practice using patient and clinician stories, clinical benefits, practice guides, and documentary film.

>It begins with a simple motion: the turning of your patient's arm. This initial movement is a new beginning, the first step in a journey towards reclaiming hope, strength, and going home.<br>
><br>
>For the most critically ill ICU patients, mobility seems implausible, even hazardous. Yet even in the slightest increments, movement can foster progress. Day by day, little by little, a simple motion can start a positive cycle that can improve outcomes and empower patients, their families, and their clinicians.<br>

>Medtronic is committed to supporting clinicians as they work to improve care in the ICU. That's why we're partnering with ICUs worldwide to educate, support, and empower ICU interdisciplinary teams working to implement early mobility programs.</i>
